                    <h4 class="first">How to Act When Your Driver’s License Is Suspended</h4>
                    <p>The first thing you should do after a license suspension in Ontario is call Get Legal Help for a     consultation. There are many complex reasons that can lead to a driver’s license being suspended, an    experienced traffic ticket lawyers or paralegals will examine every aspect of your driving to determine if     you can fight the charges that led to the suspension. If your license remains suspended, we will take every     legal action necessary to help you have it reinstated as soon as possible.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Reasons Driver’s Licenses May Be Suspended</h4>
                    <p>There are numerous reasons your driver’s license could be suspended in Ontario. Common causes include:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li><i>Accumulated Demerit Points</i> – Many traffic tickets come with demerit points. If you are convicted of these   offences, the points are added to your driving record. If the total number of points reaches 15 or more, or 9     or more for new drivers, your license will be suspended for 30 or 60 days respectively. Even before these   thresholds, you may be asked to attend a meeting to discuss if your license should be suspended. This is why  it is so important to hire a traffic ticket lawyer to fight every ticket.</li>
                    <li><i>Failure to Appear/Pay</i> – If you fail to appear at meetings with the Ministry or if you do not pay    outstanding fines, this can also lead to a driver’s license suspension. This does not mean pay fines as soon   as you receive them; paying is an admission of guilt. Consult with one of our traffic ticket attorneys first. </li>
                    <li><i>Criminal Driving Offences</i> – A criminal driving offence conviction, such as a driving under the influence    conviction, can lead to automatic suspension of your license.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="first">Do Not Drive with a Suspended License</h4>
                    <p>Driving without a license is a serious offence in Toronto and throughout Ontario. A driving under    suspension ticket can lead to an extended suspension, large fines, and even imprisonment. Being unaware of     your suspension is not an acceptable defense for these charges, making it all the more crucial that you stay    well informed of your driving record.</p>

                    <h3>Lane Change Tickets in Toronto, Ontario</h3>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>You see the turn that you need to make and absentmindedly make a lane change without signaling to other drivers. Even if you do not cause an accident, this action can lead to lane change tickets in Toronto and throughout Ontario.</p>
                    <p>Even extremely careful drivers are not perfect and can find themselves faced with unsafe lane change, improper left turn, or failure to signal lane change tickets. You may even feel that you did signal and behaved properly, while law enforcement officials see the circumstances differently. Our paralegal team can provide you with traffic ticket legal representation to ensure that you have a strong defense.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Understanding Unsafe Lane Change Ontario Law</h4>
                    <p>Unsafe lane changes are covered under section 154(1a) of the Highway Traffic Act of Ontario. The law states that drivers shall remain within a single lane until the driver has determined that a lane change can be made safely.</p>
                    <p>Similar to many other areas of traffic law, this rule leaves much room for interpretation. A driver may feel that he has reasonably checked to ensure that a lane change can be made completely safely, while other drivers may have differing opinions. This is why the services of a traffic lawyer can be very beneficial.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Punishment for Unsafe Lane Changes</h4>
                    <p>If you do receive a ticket for an unsafe lane change in Ontario, you face the following penalties:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Two or three demerit points are added to your driver’s license</li>
                    <li>A fine of $85 in addition to a government victim surcharge</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These penalties may seem minimal, but can have a significant impact on your privilege to operate a vehicle in the future. If you accumulate fifteen or more demerit points on your license, your license is suspended for a minimum of thirty days.</p>
                    <p>Another consequence of having an unsafe lane change ticket on your driving record is that insurance companies will likely increase your rates. You do not want auto insurance companies to view you as an unsafe driver, as this indicates that you are a higher risk customer.</p>
                    <h4  class="first">Fighting Traffic Tickets in Ontario</h4>
                    <p>Whether you have been ticketed for changing lanes improperly, failing to signal, an improper left turn, or other similar violations, our traffic ticket lawyers can help you fight these charges.</p>
                    <p>There are many factors to take into consideration when building a defense. The road that you were traveling may have unclear or hidden signage that contributed to your error, other drivers may have affected your decision-making process, or you may not have actually made any driving mistakes and the circumstance is a misunderstanding.</p>
                    <p>Our job is to perform all of the investigating necessary to uncover all of these factors and more. We are then able to present every aspect of your case to build a strong legal defense for you. With our help, your Toronto unsafe lane change ticket could be dismissed completely or your fine or demerit points could be decreased. We want to help you keep your license, reduce your fines, and protect your right to drive in Toronto.</p>

                    <h3>Seat Belt Tickets in Toronto, Ontario</h3>
                    <hr/>
                    <h4 class="first">How Seat Belt Tickets Are Given</h4>
                    <p>In most cases, seat belt tickets are issued when a police officer has stopped your vehicle for some other    reason. While following you and pulling you over, the officer watches to see if you are moving to conceal any  items or if you are putting on your seat belt. Ontario sometimes have safety blitzes in an effort to make    drivers more aware of necessary safety precautions. During these blitzes, officers set up on ramps or other    highway areas, watching passing vehicles for any passengers not wearing seat belts. Thousands of seat belt     tickets may be issued in a manner of days.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Here’s what you need to know:</h4>
                    <h4 class="second">Seat Belt Ticket Ontario Law and Drivers</h4>
                    <h5>HTA s. 106(1)</h5>
                    <p>No Person shall drive on a highway a motor vehicle in which a seat belt assembly required under the Motor    Vehicle Safety Act (Canada) at the time that the vehicle was manufactured or imported into Canada has been     removed, rendered partly or wholly inoperative, modified so as to reduce its effectiveness or is not    operating properly through lack of maintenance.</p>
                    <h4 class="second">Seat Belt Ticket Ontario Law and Passengers</h4>
                    <h5>HTA s. 106(3)</h5>
                    <p>Every person who is at least 16 years old and is a passenger in a motor vehicle on a highway shall,</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>a) occupy a seating position for which a seat belt assembly has been provided;</li>
                    <li>b) wear the complete seat belt assembly as required by subsection (5)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="second">Seat Belt Ticket Ontario Law and Young Children</h4>
                    <p>Get Legal Help will assist you with in situations where your young child or passenger has un-fastened their seat-belts without the Driver’s knowledge.</p>

                    <h4 class="second">The Ontario Seat-Belt Ticket Penalty</h4>
                    <ul>
                    <li>2 Demerit Points</li>
                    <li>$200 + Government imposed Surcharge</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Forgetting to wear your seat belt even once can seriously impact your driving record. You can receive a seat belt ticket if you are not wearing your seat belt, or if one or your passengers is not wearing his or her seat belt. Paying the fine for the ticket is not your only option if you receive one of these tickets. Consult with Get Legal Help to learn more about how you can fight a seat belt ticket.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Can You Fight a Seat Belt Ticket?</h4>
                    <p>A seat belt conviction often relies upon the police officer’s perception and notes on the traffic stop. Even with detailed notes, it is possible for the officer to be mistaken or not be capable of accurately recalling the events. Our skilled traffic ticket attorneys can use this to help you fight the conviction and potentially have your seat belt ticket dismissed completely. At Get Legal Help, we retain the services of former police officers and prosecutors, as well as traffic ticket lawyers and paralegals. Our experts know the challenges that police officers face when it comes to proving seat belt violations, and we know all of the right questions to ask. Were obstructions blocking the view of the officer? Did you remove your seat belt before the officer approached the car, but after coming to a stop? In addition to looking for legal technicalities that can help with your case, we also study previous seat belt cases to determine which defences are most successful. If any of those defences are relevant to your case, we can then build a strong defence that is accurate for your circumstance and has a high chance of leading to a positive outcome.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Is It Worth It To Fight a Seat Belt Ticket?</h4>
                    <p>While driving without your seatbelt may be a minor driving offence, it is one that can follow you for quite some time. This ticket comes with a fine of $200 or more and two demerit points added to your license. If you have or receive more tickets, and more demerit points, you run the risk of having your license suspended. Even if you do not have any other tickets on your record, this ticket may cause your insurance costs to increase and could make it difficult for you to work with businesses that require you to have a clean driving record. It is worthwhile to at least consult with one of our traffic ticket professional in Toronto before you pay your seat belt ticket.</p>

                    <h3>Suspended Driver’s License Toronto</h3>
                    <hr/>
                    <p>Some drivers make the mistake of thinking that driving with a suspended driver’s license in Toronto is not so serious, since the license was not completely revoked. This is certainly not the case, and driving under a suspended license is a serious offence that can come with punishments of hefty fines or even jail time.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Penalties for Driving Under Suspension in Ontario</h4>
                    <p>According to the Ministry of Transportation, if your license is suspended due to a Highway Traffic Act (HTA) conviction, and you are then convicted of driving under suspension, you will face the following punishments:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Your first offence: A fine of $1,000 to $5,000</li>
                    <li>Additional offences that occur within the next five years: A fine of $2,000 to $5,000, a jail sentence of up to six months, or both.</li>
                    <li>Your license suspension is also extended an additional 6 months.</li>
                    <li>If your license is suspended due to a Criminal Code conviction, such as driving while under the influence, the penalties for driving under suspension increase significantly:</li>
                    <li>Your first offence: A fine of $5,000 to $25,000.</li>
                    <li>Additional offences that occur within the next five years: A fine of $10,000 to $50,000, a prison sentence of up to 2 years, or both.</li>
                    <li>Your license suspension is extended an additional year after your first offence, and extended 2 years for any subsequent offences.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="first">I Did Not Know My License Was Suspended</h4>
                    <p>Some drivers unknowingly drive with suspended licenses because they did not know about the suspension. Unfortunately, this is not an acceptable defense, and you can still be convicted.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Reasons Your License May Be Suspended in Toronto</h4>
                    <p>There are many reasons your license may be suspended, and not all of them are traffic violations. Common reasons include, but are not limited to:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>An Impaired Driving conviction</li>
                    <li>Failing to appear in court or attend a Ministry of Transportation Driver’s Interview</li>
                    <li>Unpaid Traffic Ticket fines</li>
                    <li>15 or more demerit points on your driving record</li>
                    <li>Drug offence convictions</li>
                    <li>Driving without insurance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4 class="first">Seeking Legal Help for Traffic Violations</h4>
                    <p>The best way to avoid a driving under suspension conviction is to seek the help of a Legal Professional. If you are facing any Traffic violations, or other offences that could lead to a driver’s license suspension, consult with our  Paralegal to learn more about your options. Our paralegals can help you learn whether or not your license is suspended to help you avoid unknowingly driving without a valid license.</p>
                    <p>While serious, driving under suspension charges are also quite complex and a strong legal defense can have a large impact on the outcome of your case. </p>

                    <hr/>
                    <p>Receiving a stunt driving ticket in Toronto may make it sound like you are a daring Hollywood driver, but in reality, your driver’s license is in peril and you could even be facing imprisonment. This is definitely not the time to try going into court to provide your own defense. We strongly recommend you enlist the support of Get Legal Help. The Principal of the organization was a Police Officer for 10 years. With access to experienced traffic ticket lawyers, ex-cops, and other skilled paralegals we can assist you.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Fighting Stunt Driving Case Study- An Actual Client</h4>
                    <p>In this particular case, the evidence against the Defendant supported a conviction. We attempted to achieve a straight plea to Speed. We were shot down but did not give up. On the court date, after discussions with the Prosecution, an agreement was reached for a plea of guilty to the Speeding charge. The same resolution request, that had been rejected, by the Crown, for months. To the extreme delight of our client the Stunt Driving Charge would be withdrawn. However, it was discovered that the police officer was away on course, and would not be attending the court proceedings. The astute Paralegal would not consent to an adjournment, even though the Crown had offered to withdrawn the Stunt and, as a direct result, of 37 years of legal experience, tenacity and legal know how both the charges of Speeding and Stunt Driving were withdrawn. Our client walked out of court with no conviction, no demerit points or insurance implications.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">What Is Stunt Driving In Ontario?</h4>
                    <p>Stunt driving does not simply include driving at dangerous speeds or performing bold jumps and skids with your vehicle. There are actually a surprising number of driving activities that can lead to this type of traffic ticket, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Driving 50 or more KM per HR over the speed limit</li>
                    <li>Driving your car in a way that interferes with the flow of traffic, including preventing cars from passing without reason</li>
                    <li>Performing “donuts” – spinning your vehicle in a circular motion</li>
                    <li>Having passengers in your trunk</li>
                    <li>Unsafe turns</li>
                    <li>Driving with the intent of losing some or all traction</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These are just a few of the activities that can lead to a stunt driving ticket. Many other actions that put yourself and other drivers at risk can also lead to dangerous driving or stunt driving tickets.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Punishments for Ontario Stunt Driving</h4>
                    <p>If you are found to be stunt driving in Toronto or throughout Ontario, you could face the following punishments and costs:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>A fine of $2,000 to $10,000</li>
                    <li>A jail sentence of up to six months</li>
                    <li>Suspension of your driver’s license for seven days</li>
                    <li>Your vehicle may be impounded for seven days</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Previous or concurrent tickets may increase the severity of your punishment. Another substantial cost of a stunt driving ticket is that your insurance costs will increase and some insurance companies may not want to provide coverage for you at all.</p>
                    <h4 class="first">Fighting a Stunt Driving Ticket</h4>
                    <p>Stunt driving charges are certainly not taken lightly. Claiming that you were unaware that you were violating these laws is not going to cut it in court. What you need is the defense of our skilled team of traffic ticket paralegals.</p>
                    <p>We take the time to investigate every aspect of your case. We want to know the who, what, why, and where(s) associated with your case. This helps us build a strong defense that could lead to your charges being reduced or even dismissed.</p>
